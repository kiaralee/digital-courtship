# digital-courtship
<b>a date generator for the digital age.</b>

something I found challenging about maintaining a relationship while self-isolating due to covid-19 is thinking of things to do long-distance. digital courtship is a web app designed to solve that problem.

users can add and randomly generate a date from the database.
